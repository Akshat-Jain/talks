\section{Conclusion}

The current state of art of the GPU HPC is not flexible enough for most of our
performance hungry applications, noteable among them being machine learning and
simulations. This problem of is tackled by the HSA by providing a unified
computing framework. A single address space accessible to both CPU and GPU,
which makes it very easy to write highly efficeint programs in this type of
architecture. This increases programming productivity and also does not demand
a lot of skill on the progammer side, which will benefit overall applications
and adoption of this architecture in the main stream. This architecture is
already mainstream and only will improve further as major companies have
invested a lot in this programming model.
