\subsection{Moore's Law}
The number of transistors doubles roughly every 18 months.
\subsection{Amdhal's Law}
If \texttt{P} is the proportion of a system of program that can be made parallel, and \texttt{1 - P} is the proportion that remains serial, then max speedup that can be achieved using N number of processors is $\frac{1}{(1-P) + (P/N)}$.
\subsection{Dennard Scaling}
States thatpower for a fixed chip area remains constant as transistors grow smaller.
