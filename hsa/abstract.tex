High Performance Computing (HPC) systems are increasingly becoming
heterogeneous with the use of accelerators such as Graphics Processing
Units (GPU), Digital Signal Processors (DSP). With performance becoming
a major concern in the HPC community, alternatives to current
homogeneous systems are being considered including the heterogeneous
Mutli-Processor Systems. A heterogeneous System houses several
different kinds of accelerators and seamless coordinates with each
system to increase performance. The architecture where multiple
heterogeneous compute devices are used is called Heterogeneous System
Architecture (HSA). HSA has a profound impact on ranging from tiny
embedded devices to huge Supercomputers. The scope of HSA does not end
at GPU's but it includes other accelerators such as DSP's, DMA engines,
crypto engines etc.  The HSA architecture comprises of two main compute
units; the throughput unit and the compute unit, and benefits from the best
attributes of both.
